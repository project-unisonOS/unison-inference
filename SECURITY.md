# Security

The inference gateway is part of the UnisonOS core and brokers requests to local and (optionally) cloud model providers under policy control.

For overall security and privacy guidance, including how cloud providers are treated as optional and policy-gated, see:

If you discover a security issue in unison-inference, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
